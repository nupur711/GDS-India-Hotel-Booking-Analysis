As a strategic move, the managing director of GDS Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. 
However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights 
from their historical data.
